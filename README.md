# Babarify Media Player

**Play • Enjoy • Anytime.** A free, privacy-focused media player by Babarify.

> Status: **Milestone 4 — Playback Reliability and Performance** (awaiting acceptance). The app
> plays local video and audio in a branded interface, reports honestly whether the GPU or the
> CPU is decoding, offers a Playback info panel (Ctrl+I), and is tested against a 42-file corpus,
> long sessions, seek storms and shutdown in every state. See
> [the plan](Babarify_Vision_Official_Architecture_and_Milestones.md) and the milestone
> reports for [M1](docs/milestones/M1/), [M2](docs/milestones/M2/) and [M3](docs/milestones/M3/).

- No ads, no account, no telemetry by default.
- First platform: Windows 10/11 64-bit. An Android version (10 or later) is built in `android/player` but not yet released. iOS comes after a dedicated feasibility milestone.
- Playback engine: **libVLC** (provisional, [ADR-0001](docs/decisions/ADR-0001-playback-engine.md));
  mpv is kept as a maintained alternative.

## Development setup (Windows)

Requirements: Windows 10/11 x64, Python 3.13 (x64), Git. FFmpeg on `PATH` is only
needed to regenerate benchmark media.

```powershell
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Engine libraries (development only)

The engines are native libraries and are not installed by pip. Put 64-bit builds in
the git-ignored `.engines/` folder (or point `BABARIFY_VLC_DIR` / `BABARIFY_MPV_DIR` at them):

| Engine | Source used in M1 | Expected layout |
|---|---|---|
| libVLC 3.0.24 x64 | `vlc-3.0.24-win64.zip` from download.videolan.org (SHA-256 verified) | `.engines/vlc/vlc-3.0.24/libvlc.dll` + `plugins/` |
| libmpv | `mpv-dev-x86_64-20261021-git-e471496c56.7z` from shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake (linked from mpv.io; GitHub digest verified) | `.engines/mpv/libmpv-2.dll` |

A 32-bit VLC installation cannot be used from 64-bit Python.

## Run

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m babarify_frame [FILE] [--engine libvlc|mpv]
```

Open files with **Ctrl+O**, by dragging them onto the window, or as a command-line argument.
Drop a folder (or use *File → Add folder to library…*) to add it to the **Library**: only the
folders you choose are scanned, in the background, and files are never modified. A file is deleted only
when you choose to and confirm.
Files continue where you stopped; *Home* lists *Continue watching* and *Recently played*.
History stays on this PC and can be turned off or cleared in *Settings → Privacy*.
Network streams (http, https, HLS, internet radio, rtsp) open with **Ctrl+N** or by dropping a
link; Babarify fetches web streams itself and never follows a redirect or playlist entry to a
local file or another program. Point at the seek bar for a preview picture (local videos).
Optional local AI (*Settings → AI features*, off by default): generate subtitles from speech and
search what is said. It runs on this PC only; nothing is uploaded. Install with
`pip install -e .[ai]`; the speech model (75–148 MB) is downloaded in the app after you confirm.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Space | Play / pause |
| ← / → | Seek back / forward (step set in Settings, default 10 s) |
| ↑ / ↓ | Volume up / down |
| M | Mute |
| S | Stop |
| F, F11, double-click video | Fullscreen (Esc to leave) |
| Ctrl+1 / 2 / 3 | Home / Now Playing / Settings |
| Ctrl+O / Ctrl+Q | Open / exit |
| Ctrl+N | Open a network stream |
| Ctrl+→ / Ctrl+← | Next / previous chapter (also *Playback → Chapters*) |
| Ctrl+B / Ctrl+Shift+B | Add a bookmark / list bookmarks |
| Ctrl+Shift+I | Media information (tracks, tags, chapters) |
| Ctrl+Shift+G | Generate subtitles from speech (local AI, when turned on) |
| Ctrl+Shift+F | Search spoken words in generated subtitles |
| Ctrl+I | Playback info (decoder, frames, engine log) |
| Ctrl+L | Library |
| N / P | Next / previous in playlist |
| Home | Start over (after an automatic resume) |
| Ctrl+E | Picture & Sound: brightness, contrast, colour, aspect, crop, zoom, rotation, equalizer, profiles |
| Shift+S | Snapshot to Pictures\Babarify Media Player |
| . / , | Next / previous frame |
| L | A-B repeat (set A, set B, off) |
| V / B | Next subtitle track / next audio track |
| G / H | Subtitles 50 ms earlier / later |
| J / K | Audio 50 ms earlier / later |
| Ctrl+D | Sync and delay dialog |
| Ctrl+Shift+O | Load a subtitle file (or drop one onto a playing video) |
| F1 | Keyboard shortcuts |

Playback keys act on the Now Playing page. The subtitles button in the control bar lists audio
and subtitle tracks. Preferences (volume, window size, seek step, hardware decoding
Automatic/Off, fullscreen behaviour, subtitle look and preferred languages) are stored only on this PC in `%APPDATA%\Babarify\Frame\settings.json`
(override the folder with `BABARIFY_CONFIG_DIR`).

`--smoke-test [MS]` opens the window (and FILE), then exits after MS milliseconds (used by tests).

## Checks

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check .
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff format --check .
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m mypy
```

Integration tests skip automatically when an engine library or the generated media is
missing (generate it with `tools\engine-benchmark\make_media.py`). mpv tests are opt-in:
set `BABARIFY_TEST_MPV=1` (see M1 finding S1). Resource stress tests run separately:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -m stress -s
```

The test corpus and the regression catalog are documented in
[docs/testing/](docs/testing/).

## Engine benchmark

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\engine-benchmark\make_media.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\engine-benchmark\bench.py --trials 5
```

See [tools/engine-benchmark/README.md](tools/engine-benchmark/README.md).
